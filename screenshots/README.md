# Screenshots

This folder contains example screenshots of the AirGAP-AI system running locally and offline.

The images are intended to demonstrate:

- Normal technical assistance using InteleViewer documentation
- Refusal of unsafe or non-compliant requests involving patient data
- Enforcement of access-control and clinical boundaries
- Honest handling of unknown information without hallucination
